Receiving corrections from colleagues is an integral part of group work. However, people may take them emotionally, which could be very costly for a person who corrects them as collaboration is essential in group work. This paper studies how being corrected by others in a group affects one's willingness to collaborate with those people in later works in a quasi-laboratory experimental setting. I find that the main determinant of collaborator selection is a given person's contribution to the task. However, after controlling for the contribution, people are significantly less willing to collaborate with a person who has corrected their actions. Women do not like being corrected both for their mistakes and for their right actions, while men mostly do not like being corrected for their mistakes. High-ability men especially do not like to be corrected for their mistakes, suggesting that their emotional irritation is driving their negative reactions. The gender of the person who made corrections does not matter. These findings have implications for organizational efficiency, gender differences in managerial practice, corrections, and strategic behaviors.

<strong><a href="/files/CareerProgression.pdf" target="_blank">Do Competent Women Receive Unfavorable Treatment?</a></strong> [<a href="#/" onclick="visib('careerprog')">Abstract</a>]
<div id="careerprog" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2"><small>
Do competent women receive unfavorable treatment than equally competent men? While literature finds that competent women are perceived as less likable, its direct effect on women's career is not well investigated. I study this question in a laboratory experiment where unfavorable treatment has material consequences. I find that neither men nor women treat competent women less favorably; if anything, both men and women treat competent women slightly more favorably than equally competent men. The findings provide a piece of evidence that competent women may not necessarily receive unfavorable treatment, which may shed new light on hiring and promotion practices in labor markets.
