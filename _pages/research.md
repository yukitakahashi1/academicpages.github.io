Corrections among colleagues is an integral part of teamwork. Pointing out a colleague's mistake has the potential to improve team performance. However, people may take corrections as a personal criticism, and punish colleagues who corrected them. This paper studies how people react to being corrected within a team and asks whether people dislike working together with someone who corrects them. I find that people are more willing to collaborate with those who contributed more to the teamwork. However, after controlling for the contribution, people are significantly less willing to collaborate with a person who has corrected their actions. Women dislike being corrected both for their mistakes and for their right actions, while men mostly dislike being corrected only for their mistakes. High-ability men especially dislike being corrected for their mistakes, suggesting that their negative reactions are irrational. The gender of the person who made corrections does not matter. These findings have implications for organizational efficiency, gender differences in managerial practice and in strategic behaviors.

<strong><a href="/files/CareerProgression.pdf" target="_blank">Do Competent Women Receive Unfavorable Treatment?</a></strong> [<a href="#/" onclick="visib('careerprog')">Abstract</a>]

Do competent women receive unfavorable treatment than equally competent men? While literature finds that competent women are perceived as less likable, its direct effect on women's career is not well investigated. I study this question in a laboratory experiment where unfavorable treatment has material consequences. I find that neither men nor women treat competent women less favorably; if anything, both men and women treat competent women slightly more favorably than equally competent men. The findings provide a piece of evidence that competent women may not necessarily receive unfavorable treatment, which may shed new light on hiring and promotion practices in labor markets.
