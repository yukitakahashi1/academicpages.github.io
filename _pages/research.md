    <strong><a href="/files/Correction.pdf" target="_blank">Gender Differences in the Cost of Corrections in Group Work</a></strong> (postdoc JMP)
    <details> 
      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      Women speak up less often than equally knowledgeable men in a group, which reduces women's visibility in a group and group efficiency. However, speaking up corrects others who have a different opinion. Should women speak up more often to close the labor market gender gap? This paper studies women's cost of correcting male group members and its consequence to group efficiency in a setting where the quality of corrections is only partially observable, as in most group work. I design a quasi-laboratory experiment where participants first perform a joint task seven times, each time with a different participant. After performing a joint task, they state whether they would like to be paired again with each of them. Then, they play a final, payoff-relevant, round of the task with one of the participants they have previously selected. After controlling for paired participants' contribution to the joint task, I find that participants are significantly less likely to select a paired participant who has corrected their action, regardless of the paired participant's gender. Moreover, male participants react more negatively to a correction that fixes their mistake due to their overconfidence. These findings suggest that it may not be necessarily optimal for women to speak up more and that corrections do not necessarily increase group efficiency due to behavioral bias.

    <strong><a href="/files/CareerProgression.pdf" target="_blank">Do Competent Women Receive Unfavorable Treatment?</a></strong>
    <details>
      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      Do competent women receive unfavorable treatment than equally competent men? While literature finds that competent women are perceived as less likable, its direct effect on women's career is not well investigated. I study this question in a laboratory experiment where unfavorable treatment has material consequences. I find that neither men nor women treat competent women less favorably; if anything, both men and women treat competent women slightly more favorably than equally competent men. The findings provide a piece of evidence that competent women may not necessarily receive unfavorable treatment, which may shed new light on hiring and promotion practices in labor markets.

    <strong>The Effect of Identity on Labor Market Outcomes</strong> (status: design)
    <details> 
      <summary>Abstract</summary>
     Many immigrants from developing countries stay in low-income. Their origin country's status in the world is weak and they are typically non-white, and thus they must have a negative identity about their cultural and ethnic background. It would help them a lot if we can improve their lives with a simple low cost intervention. This project examines the causal effect of affirming immigrants' cultural and ethnic identity on labor market outcomes using a role model intervention. Partnering with an NGO supporting immigrants' assimilation, I conduct a series of job seminars for newly-arrived immigrants with two treatment arms: the seminar guest is an immigrant with the same cultural and ethnic origin (T1) and the seminar guest is an immigrant with different cultural and ethnic origin (T2). T1 has both the information and affirmation effect while T2 only has the information effect, and thus I can isolate the affirmation effect by comparing T1 and T2. I use the types of jobs they have applied for and accepted as measures of labor market outcomes. I also confirm that the mechanism is identity affirmation by eliciting their bias against their own cultural and ethnic background using Implicit Association Test.

    <strong>The Effect of Domestic Violence on Women's and Children's Wellbeing</strong> (status: data collection)
    <details> 
      <summary>Abstract</summary>
     In this study, I use unique Russian panel data to examine the effect of domestic violence tolerance on various dimensions of women's and children's wellbeing. I exploit the passage of domestic violence legalization law and variation in the existing cultural norms across Russia and use difference-in-differences as an identification strategy.

    <strong>The Effect of Cognitive Scarcity on Polarization</strong> (status: design)
    <details> 
      <summary>Abstract</summary>
     In this study, I test a hypothesis that people's cognitive scarcity is one reason for the recent rise in supports for anti-immigrant policies using the European Social Survey, a controlled laboratory experiment, and text analysis.
