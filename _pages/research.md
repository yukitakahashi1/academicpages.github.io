    <strong><a href="/files/Correction.pdf" target="_blank">Gender Differences in the Cost of Corrections in Group Work?</a></strong> (JMP)
    <details> 
      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      Women contribute their ideas less than equally knowledgeable men in a group. Because this reduces group efficiency and women's visibility in a group, behavioral interventions have been proposed to promote women's contribution. However, spelling out ones' ideas can result in correcting others, which in turn induces others' negative feelings and hinders the effectiveness of the interventions. This paper studies women's cost of correcting male colleagues and its consequence to group efficiency in a setting where the correctness of corrections is only partially observable as in most group work. I design a quasi-laboratory experiment where participants first try a joint task with several people who are their potential collaborators, select their collaborator from those people and work on the joint task with their collaborator. Being selected into a group is important because one's output depends on group members. I show that the main determinant of participants' collaborator selection is a given person's contribution to the joint task and they correctly believe women and men are equally good at the joint task. However, <em>when comparing people with the same contribution</em>, participants are significantly less likely to select a person who has corrected their action as a collaborator regardless of that person's gender. Moreover, male participants react more negatively to a correction that corrects their wrong action. The mechanism is participants' overconfidence about their ability. These findings suggest that behavioral interventions to increase women's contribution must be designed very carefully and that corrections, which should increase group efficiency in theory, do not necessarily do so in the real world.

    <strong><a href="/files/CareerProgression.pdf" target="_blank">Do Competent Women Receive Unfavorable Treatment?</a></strong>
    <details>
      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      Do competent women receive unfavorable treatment than equally competent men? While literature finds that competent women are perceived as less likable, its direct effect on women's career is not well investigated. I study this question in a laboratory experiment where unfavorable treatment has material consequences. I find that neither men nor women treat competent women less favorably; if anything, both men and women treat competent women slightly more favorably than equally competent men. The findings provide a piece of evidence that competent women may not necessarily receive unfavorable treatment, which may shed new light on hiring and promotion practices in labor markets.

    <strong>The Effect of Identity on Labor Market Outcomes</strong> (status: design)
    <details> 
      <summary>Abstract</summary>
     Many immigrants from developing countries stay in low-income. Their origin country's status in the world is weak and they are typically non-white, and thus they must have a negative identity about their cultural and ethnic background. It would help them a lot if we can improve their lives with a simple low cost intervention. This project examines the causal effect of affirming immigrants' cultural and ethnic identity on labor market outcomes using a role model intervention. Partnering with an NGO supporting immigrants' assimilation, I conduct a series of job seminars for newly-arrived immigrants with two treatment arms: the seminar guest is an immigrant with the same cultural and ethnic origin (T1) and the seminar guest is an immigrant with different cultural and ethnic origin (T2). T1 has both the information and affirmation effect while T2 only has the information effect, and thus I can isolate the affirmation effect by comparing T1 and T2. I use the types of jobs they have applied for and accepted as measures of labor market outcomes. I also confirm that the mechanism is identity affirmation by eliciting their bias against their own cultural and ethnic background using Implicit Association Test.

    <strong>The Effect of Cognitive Scarcity on Polarization</strong> (status: design)
    <details> 
      <summary>Abstract</summary>
     Evidence and theory seem to suggest that cognitive scarcity induce people's polarization. Although polarization may be a rational behavior in some contexts -- for example, protectionism can favor some sectors at least in the short run -- it tends to be efficiency reducing in the long run. This paper establishes the causal evidence on the effect of cognitive scarcity on polarization using a laboratory experiment by exogenously induce one's cognitive scarcity. I also test a spillover and a magnification effect.
