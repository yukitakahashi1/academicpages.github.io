I have served as a teaching assistant for a masters course on Statistics for Business and Economics at the <a href="https://sais.jhu.edu/sais-europe" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins Bologna</a> in Spring 2019 where I held a weekly TA office hour. Before starting my PhD, I have also served as a teaching assistant for undergraduate courses on International Economics and Money and Banking at <a href="https://www.icu.ac.jp/en/" target="_blank">International Christian University</a> where I graded homework.
