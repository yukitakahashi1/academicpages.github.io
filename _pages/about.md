<img src="/images/profile.jpg" alt="profile photo" width="280px" height="auto" style="float: left; padding-right:20px"/>   I am a 4th year PhD candidate in economics at the <a href="https://phd.unibo.it/economics/en" target="_blank">University of Bologna</a>. I work on topics in behavioral, labor, and gender economics with a particular interest in social inequality. In my posdoc paper, I demonstrate that people do not like to collaborate with people who corrected them in the past. In particular, high-ability men really do not like to collaborate with people who corrected their mistakes.

**I am currently looking for a postdoc position. You can find my postdoc paper <a href="files/Correction.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.**
