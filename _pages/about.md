<img src="/images/profile.jpg" alt="profile photo" width="280px" height="auto" style="float: left; padding-right:20px"/>   I am a 4th year PhD candidate in economics at the <a href="https://phd.unibo.it/economics/en" target="_blank">University of Bologna</a>. <!--I am also a coordinator of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ideemeetings/" target="_blank">IDEE meetings</a> where researchers discuss their experimental design and preliminary results in an informal setting.--> <!-- I am a member of <a href="https://women-in-economics.com/" target="_blank">Women in Economics Initiative</a>, a great organization established to advance gender equality in the field of economics. -->

I work on topics in behavioral, labor, and gender economics. I am primarily interested in questions that address inequalities in society. So far, my research has been relying on controlled laboratory experiments. However, there are a few in-progress works that also exploit field settings and administrative data in my pipeline and I use both experimental and empirical methods to best answer my research questions.
