I work on topics in behavioral and labor economics.

I am currently a coordinator of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ideemeetings/" target="_blank">IDEE meetings</a>, platforms for all researchers in experimental and behavioral economics to informally discuss their research projects.

<p class="abstract">Psychology literature has long argued that both men and women perceive a woman competent in male-typed tasks as less likeable. If people perceive a competent woman as less likeable, then she receives less support from her colleagues and faces difficulty in pursuing her career in male-typed occupations such as corporate workers, politicians, and STEM professionals. However, almost all psychological studies examine this question in hypothetical decisions that may not translate into the real world. I provide evidence that this likeability penalty does not exist in a real stake decision. Using a laboratory experiment where I exogenously vary the opponent's gender and the relative performance in an IQ test -- which measures competency in male-typed tasks -- I find neither men nor women are less generous to a woman with a better IQ test performance relative to a man with an equivalent IQ test performance. The results are not due to an in-group preference, a wrong belief that women are worse at the IQ test than men, or the experimental manipulation failure.</p>
